//2. Library Management System
//Concepts: Inheritance, file handling, abstract classes, interfaces.
//        Description:
//Create an abstract class LibraryItem with fields like title, author, and abstract methods such as displayInfo().
//Implement subclasses like Book, Magazine, and Newspaper that extend LibraryItem and implement displayInfo().
//Create an interface Loanable with methods like loanItem() and returnItem(), which will be implemented by Book and Magazine but not by Newspaper.
//Use file handling to store and retrieve library items from a text file or binary file.
